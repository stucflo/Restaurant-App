# FEND Restaurant Review App
---

## App Description

This App simulates a **Restaurant Review Site** This site was produced with starter code given by Udacity at this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git). My task was to fix problems, and create a Javascript Service Worker that creates an offline first experience in case the user has limited or no internet connection.

### How to run the APP?

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. You can use [Google Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) to do this, you can get it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)

A Web Server for Chrome, serves web pages from a local folder over the network, using HTTP. Runs offline.
Web Server for Chrome is an open source (MIT) HTTP server for Chrome.

It runs anywhere that you have Chrome installed, so you can take it anywhere. It even works on ARM chromebooks.

It now has the option to listen on the local network, so other computers can access your files. Additionally, it can try and get an internet address.

Many people use this to do basic web development on a chromebook. It is also handy for sharing files over a local network between computers, or even on the internet.

Once you install it, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8887

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
